# Reset Point
**A Behavioral Health Report for Retail Traders**

Reset Point is a behavioral health tool for retail traders that analyzes historical trading data to show how decision-making changes under stress and how quickly behavior recovers after losses. Instead of predicting markets or optimizing trades, Reset Point compares traders only to their own baseline, identifies moments of behavioral bias, and presents a clear, reflective summary designed to promote healthier long-term financial habits.
